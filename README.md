# Mandelbrot-Visualization

This repository contains Python implementations for visualizing the **Mandelbrot** and **Julia sets**, as well as the **Dragon Fractal**. These projects explore the convergence behavior of complex dynamical systems and the beauty of recursive algorithms.

## Mathematical Context
The fractals studied here are generated by iteratively applying a complex function to each point $c$ (or $z$) in the complex plane. The standard iteration used is:
$$z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$$

The visualization consists of plotting the **escape time**: the number of iterations required for the sequence to diverge beyond a certain threshold. Points that do not diverge within the maximum number of iterations are considered part of the set.

### Results
Here is an example of the fractal generated by the scripts:
